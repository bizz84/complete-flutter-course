# Foundations Course - February 2023 Update

During the upgrade to `riverpod_generator` 1.2.0 and `flutter_riverpod` 2.2.0, some deprecated member warnings appeared when running `flutter analyze`:

```
Analyzing ecommerce_app...                                              

   info • 'debugGetCreateSourceHash' is deprecated and shouldn't be used. Will be removed in 3.0.0 • lib/src/exceptions/error_logger.g.dart:38:3 • deprecated_member_use
   info • 'debugGetCreateSourceHash' is deprecated and shouldn't be used. Will be removed in 3.0.0 • lib/src/features/authentication/data/fake_auth_repository.g.dart:38:3 • deprecated_member_use
```

These can all be resolved by running the code generator again:

```
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

The latest code in the `main` branch is already updated, but old code snapshots in the course are not (this only affects section 13).
