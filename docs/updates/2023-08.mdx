# Foundations Course - August 2023 Update

Mainly **minor** changes:

- Updated course to Flutter 3.13, Dart 3.1
- Updated course to latest package versions

To run the latest code, make sure you're running on Flutter 3.13 (run `flutter upgrade` if you're still on an older version).

Also note that Flutter 3.13 requires **Xcode 14** and **macOS 13** to develop for iOS and macOS.

Here are the most important details for each section / lesson. 👇

### Section 1

- Added `useMaterial3: false` flag to `ThemeData` in `MaterialApp` (the next Flutter release will switch to Material 3 by default but we don't need that)
- Updated `showAlertDialog` function in `alert_dialogs.dart` to use the new `AlertDialog.adaptive` constructor that was added to Flutter 3.13
- Updated to `flutter_layout_grid: 2.0.4` to fix a compile issue with Flutter 3.13

### Section 2

We’ll be using **GoRouter version 10.1**.

As a result, some code changes are needed:

Lesson 02.03:

- Install `go_router: 10.1.0`

Lesson 02.10:

- Set `GoRouter.optionURLReflectsImperativeAPIs = true` inside `main`. This is necessary to preserve the old URL navigation behavior on Flutter web (and also prevents an issue with redirects).

Lesson 02.12:

- Updated notes to show the usage of `AlertDialog.adaptive` in the `showAlertDialog` function

### Section 4

Lesson 04.03:

- Updated `pubspec.yaml` to use `flutter_riverpod: 2.3.7`

### Section 5

Lesson 05.21:

- Following the removal of `GoRouterState.location` in [GoRouter 10.0](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router/changelog#1000), the code has been updated to use the `state.uri.path` property instead (see notes)

### Section 6

Lesson 06.12:

- Install `mocktail: 1.0.0`

Lessons 13,14,15:

- As of `state_notifier: 1.0.0` (which is installed with `flutter_riverpod: 2.3.7`), `state` is now accessible in tests without a warning (see the [changelog](https://pub.dev/packages/state_notifier/changelog#100---2023-08-16))
- So I've replaced `controller.debugState` with `controller.state` in the tests code

### Section 7

Lesson 07.11:

- Added note about setting `GoRouter.optionURLReflectsImperativeAPIs = true` inside `pumpMyApp()`.

Lesson 07.14:

- Updated notes to mention [Patrol](https://patrol.leancode.co/) for integration testing.
