# Foundations Course - November 2022 Update

This update brings the course up to date with Riverpod 2.1 and adds some other small code improvements.

## CHANGELOG

Lesson 04.03:

- Updated starter project, now using Riverpod 2.1
- Updated `main.dart` to use new Flutter 3.3 error handling code based on `PlatformDispatcher` (see [Handling errors in Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/errors))

Lesson 05.08:

- Updated to mention the new `AsyncNotifier` class as a replacement for `StateNotifier` (added in Riverpod 2.0)
- `AsyncNotifier` will be covered in the upcoming section 13

Lesson 08.11:

- Updated to show some new Riverpod 2.0 APIs (such as `AsyncLoading<int>().copyWithPrevious(state)`)

Lesson 08.25:

- Updated notes to mention that `StreamProvider.overrideWithValue` has been removed.
- Updated tests to show how to use `overrideWith` using streams rather than `AsyncValue`

Lesson 10.08:

- Updated to show how to use the `ErrorLogger` class together with `PlatformDispatcher` in `main.dart`

Lesson 11.02:

- Reviews feature: updated starter project using a simplified implementation
- removed `Purchase` and `FakePurchasesRepository` classes as the corresponding functionality is now implemented inside `FakeOrdersRepository` and `matchingUserOrdersProvider`

Lesson 11.10:

- Recorded entire lesson again, using the new `matchingUserOrdersProvider`

## New section 13 about Riverpod Generator and AsyncNotifier

This section will be released in the next few weeks.
