# Foundations Course - October 2022 Update

This update brings the course up to date with Flutter 3.3, GoRouter 5.0 and Riverpod 2.0.

## CHANGELOG

### Updated the initial starter project to Flutter 3.3 and Dart 2.18

Lesson 01.06 onwards:

- `flutter_lints` is now listed under `dev_dependencies`
- updated `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to 11.0 on iOS and macOS projects
- updated `backgroundColor` and `foregroundColor` properties when working with `ElevatedButton` (since Flutter 3.3)
- use `{super.key}` in all the widget constructors (supported since Dart 2.18) â†’ *these changes have been applied to all the code snapshots, but many video lessons will still show the old `{Key? key}` syntax*

### Use GoRouter 5.x

Lesson 02.03:

- Installed `go_router: 5.0.1`
- Use new `routerConfig` argument of `MaterialApp.router` (supported since Flutter 3.3)

Lesson 02.13:

- Pending GoRouter 5.1 release: update with additional references to the **stateful nested navigation** feature

Lesson 05.21:

- `redirect` function now takes an additional `BuildContext` argument

Lesson 05.22:

- Added `GoRouterRefreshStream` class to be used with `refreshListenable` 

### Use Riverpod 2.x

Lesson 04.03:

- Installed `flutter_riverpod: 2.0.0-dev.9`
- Due to [this issue](https://github.com/rrousselGit/riverpod/issues/1713), the course project doesn't use the official Riverpod 2.0 release yet. I'll update relevant lessons when this is fixed

Lesson 04.09:

- Updated to clarify how to cache results with Riverpod 2.0 using the `keepAlive` method

Lessons 08.11 and 08.25:

- Updated notes to reflect the breaking changes introduced by Riverpod 2.0 (`AsyncError` syntax and removal of `overrideWithValue` from most providers)

Lessons 12.05, 12.06:

- Replace `cacheTime` with `keepAlive()`

### Other Minor Changes

Lesson 02.12:

- Updated to clarify how to deal with "Don't use a BuildContext across an asynchronous gap" warning
