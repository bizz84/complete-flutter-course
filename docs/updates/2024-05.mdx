# Foundations Course - May 2024 Update

Mainly **minor** changes:

- Updated course to Flutter 3.22, Dart 3.4
- Updated course to latest package versions

Also regenerated all target platforms (ios, macos, android, web) with the latest flutter CLI. As a result, the project now uses the latest [Flutter web app initialization](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/bootstrapping) code.
