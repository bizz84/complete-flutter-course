# Foundations Course - November 2023 Update

Mainly **minor** changes:

- Updated course to Flutter 3.16, Dart 3.2
- Updated course to latest package versions
- Enabled Material 3 in the project (`useMaterial3: true`)

To run the latest code, make sure you're running on Flutter 3.16 (run `flutter upgrade` if you're still on an older version).

I also recommend to upgrade to **Xcode 15** and **Cocoapods 1.13.0** or above if you want to develop for iOS and macOS.

Here are the most important details for each section / lesson. ðŸ‘‡

### Section 1

- Set `useMaterial3: true` flag in the `ThemeData` of `MaterialApp`

### Section 2

- Updated course to GoRouter 12.1.1
- In lesson 10, mention that we will no longer use `push` and the `optionURLReflectsImperativeAPIs` flag since they cause problems with `redirect` and `refreshListenable`

### Section 4

- Updated to Riverpod 2.4.6

### Section 6

- Update test code to use `controller.state` since `debugState` is deprecated

### Section 8

- Update notes in lesson 5, explaining what options are available when initializing async dependencies (see [this tip](https://github.com/bizz84/flutter-tips-and-tricks/blob/main/tips/0131-future-provider-require-value/index.md) for more details)
