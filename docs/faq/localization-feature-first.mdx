# How to deal with localization (multiple `arb` files) with the feature-first approach

The [official internationalization docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization) explain how Flutter can generate localized strings for your project from a single `arb` file.

But as the app grows, it would be nicer to have one `arb` file for each feature. Here are some resources that explain the process in more detail:

- [Organise .arb files in flutter using Flutter intl extension | StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65440222/organise-arb-files-in-flutter-using-flutter-intl-extension)
