# Error: ADB exited with exit code 1 - Requested internal only, but not enough space

If you're running the Android emulator on a low-memory machine, you may get an `INSTALL_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE` error as explained here:

In all cases, the issue seems to be that the Android emulator needs to have more internal storage. This answer shows the steps for fixing it:

- [Increasing the storage in the emulator](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71309984/436422)

This may also be solved by **wiping the emulator data**.

Then you can run these commands and try again:

```
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

### Notes about creating the Android emulator

- You can try to install devices such as `Pixel_3a_XL_API_32`, `Pixel_4a_API_32`, `Pixel_5_API_32` as they may use less memory.
