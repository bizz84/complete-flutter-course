# Enable macOS/Linux desktop support

Quoting the [official documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos#additional-macos-requirements):

> On macOS and Linux, desktop support is disabled by default in the stable channel. You can manually enable it with one of these commands, depending on which platform you are running:

```
flutter config --enable-macos-desktop
flutter config --enable-linux-desktop
```
