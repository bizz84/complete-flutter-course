# The webOnlyWarmupEngine API is deprecated and will be removed in a future release

After upgrading to Flutter stable 3.13, the following log appears when running the app on Flutter web:

```
The webOnlyWarmupEngine API is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please use `bootstrapEngine` from `dart:ui_web` instead.
The debugEmulateFlutterTesterEnvironment getter is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please use `debugEmulateFlutterTesterEnvironment` from `dart:ui_web` instead.
```

This can be ignored as it's just a warning.
