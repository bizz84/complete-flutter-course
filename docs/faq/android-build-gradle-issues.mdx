## Android build.gradle issues

Starting with Flutter 2.8, the `compileSdkVersion`, `minSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` are no longer hardcoded.

Instead, they are set like this inside `android/app/build.gradle`:

```gradle
android {
    compileSdkVersion flutter.compileSdkVersion

    defaultConfig {
        // TODO: Specify your own unique Application ID (https://developer.android.com/studio/build/application-id.html).
        applicationId "com.example.ecommerce_app"
        minSdkVersion flutter.minSdkVersion
        targetSdkVersion flutter.targetSdkVersion
        versionCode flutterVersionCode.toInteger()
        versionName flutterVersionName
    }
```

All these variables are set like this inside `android/local.properties` (note that this file is **git ignored** by default):

```
sdk.dir=/Users/andrea/Library/Android/sdk
flutter.sdk=/Users/andrea/fvm/versions/stable
flutter.buildMode=debug
flutter.versionName=1.0.0
flutter.versionCode=1
```

Note that the build may fail if these variables are not added:

```
flutter.minSdkVersion=21
flutter.targetSdkVersion=30
flutter.compileSdkVersion=30
```

There's an open issue regarding this here:

- [[Android] build.gradle defaultConfig with local.properties not working properly.](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/95533) (related [PR](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/95684))
