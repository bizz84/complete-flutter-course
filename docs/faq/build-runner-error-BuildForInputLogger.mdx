# Can't run build_runner due to BuildForInputLogger error

Either of these commands can be used to run `build_runner` (useful when generating the updated Riverpod providers):

```
dart run build_runner watch -d
flutter pub run build_runner watch -d
```

If you encounter this error:

```
Failed to build build_runner:build_runner:
../../../../../.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dev/build_runner_core-7.2.7/lib/src/logging/build_for_input_logger.dart:13:7: Error: The non-abstract class 'BuildForInputLogger' is missing implementations for these members:
 - Logger.onLevelChanged
Try to either
 - provide an implementation,
 - inherit an implementation from a superclass or mixin,
 - mark the class as abstract, or
 - provide a 'noSuchMethod' implementation.

class BuildForInputLogger implements Logger {
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
../../../../../.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dev/logging-1.2.0/lib/src/logger.dart:162:22: Context: 'Logger.onLevelChanged' is defined here.
  Stream<Level?> get onLevelChanged {
```

Then simply run this:

```
dart pub upgrade
```

That should give you a newer version of `build_runner_core` with the fix.
