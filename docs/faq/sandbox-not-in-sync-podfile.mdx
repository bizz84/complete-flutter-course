# The sandbox is not in sync with the Podfile.lock

This is a common error when running on iOS or macOS after installing new packages:

```
The sandbox is not in sync with the Podfile.lock. Run 'pod install' or update your CocoaPods installation
```

### Steps to try

```
flutter pub get

# From the root of the project folder:
cd ios
pod install
pod update

# Or likewise if you want to fix this for macOS:
cd macos
pod install
pod update
```

If this still does not work, you can also try a full clean:

```
# From the project root:
flutter clean

cd ios
rm Podfile.lock
rm -rf Pods/
pod install
pod update
```
