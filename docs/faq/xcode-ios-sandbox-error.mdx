# Xcode sandbox error when building for iOS

When building the Flutter app for iOS, you may come across this error:

- [error while build iOS app in Xcode : Sandbox: rsync.samba (13105) deny(1) file-write-create, Flutter failed to write to a file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76590131/error-while-build-ios-app-in-xcode-sandbox-rsync-samba-13105-deny1-file-w)

To fix this:

- Open the project in Xcode and go to the build settings
- Select "all" and type "sandbox" in the search filter
- Set the "User Script Sandboxing" value to **No**
