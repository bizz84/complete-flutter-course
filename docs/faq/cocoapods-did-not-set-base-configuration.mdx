# CocoaPods did not set the base configuration of your project because your project already has a custom config set

If you get a "CocoaPods did not set the base configuration of your project" warning, see this issue for more details:

- [CocoaPods did not set the base configuration of your project because your project already has a custom config set.](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/66222#issuecomment-695802808)

Note that this is **only a warning**: you can still run the app.

It can solved directly in the Xcode project as explained in [this comment](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/66222#issuecomment-695802808).

Alternatively, add the following inside `macos/Runner/Configs/AppInfo.xcconfig` or `ios/Runner/Configs/AppInfo.xcconfig`:

```
#include "Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-Runner/Pods-Runner.debug.xcconfig"
#include "Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-Runner/Pods-Runner.release.xcconfig"
#include "Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-Runner/Pods-Runner.profile.xcconfig"
```
